    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      In primary and secondary school, Red Cross Youth is a co-curricular activity (CCA) 
      that integrates character-building, leadership, essential life-saving skills, and 
      humanitarian knowledge. It encourages strong moral values and fosters meaningful 
      service to local communities through various humanitarian projects in association 
      with the Red Cross society in Singapore and many countries worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brings out the best of our Links (Primary schools), Cadets (Secondary schools), 
      and Chapters (Tertiary members) as we empower them for leadership in their families 
      and communities, equipping them with 21st-century skills to excel in both academic 
      and personal development.
